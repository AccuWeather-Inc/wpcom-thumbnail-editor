# wpcom-thumbnail-editor
Since thumbnails are generated on-demand on WordPress.com, thumbnail cropping location must be set via the URL.

This plugin adds a "Show Thumbnails" button on the attachment Edit screen (wp-admin/post.php?post=123&action=edit) where individual image subsizes can be selected and cropped.

**NOTE: The plugin is not maintained and should be considered deprecated.**
